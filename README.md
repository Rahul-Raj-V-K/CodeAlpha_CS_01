 A network sniffer, or packet analyzer, is a tool that captures and inspects network traffic, allowing users to analyze data flowing through a network. Building a basic network sniffer in Python involves using the socket library to create raw sockets capable of intercepting and parsing packets at the Ethernet and IP levels.
